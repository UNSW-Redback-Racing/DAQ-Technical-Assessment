# Cloud Technical Assessment

## Key Concepts

- Able to implement a viable CI-CD that automate deployments
- Able to design a scalable cloud architecture
- Able to implement the designed architecture into a cloud platform of your choose
- Able to justify the design decisions made, including budget, security, performance and scalability

## Tasks

It is entirely up to you how you want to approach this cloud section. You do not have to deploy everything to the cloud. You have freedom to choose how you want to deploy. For instance, you can choose to containerise the applications and deploy them, make them serverless functions and deploy them, etc. However, you will need to justify all your choices in the end.

1. Set up a CI-CD pipeline that automates the deployment of the application. 
    - Some examples of CI-CD tools are Github Actions, AWS CodeBuild, Google Cloud Build, Jenkins, Buildkite, etc.
2. Deploy applications to the cloud (using any infrastructure of code solution such as Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation, etc. is preferred). You can choose any cloud platform of your choice.
3. The deployed software should work as expected. You will need to demonstrate the working software to the interviewers.
4. During the demonstration, the interviewers may ask questions related to the solution and you will need to justify decisions made.
