# UNSW Redback Racing | Data Acquisition Technical Assessment 2024 T3

This assessment aims to gauge your current technical ability and give you a practical introduction to some of what we do here at Redback Racing. We don't expect everyone to complete everything perfectly - you may not be familiar with all the frameworks and tools mentioned here, and so you may find it helpful to consult the resources linked, as well as doing your own research.

We also highly encourage you to read through the code and try to understand how it currently works, as well as reading the terminal output of the code once you get it running.

**Please ensure you note down your approaches, thoughts and research in the [brainstorming.md](./brainstorming.md) file.**

If you have any questions/require clarification about the spec, direct them to the [#daq-ta-questions](https://discord.com/channels/884232338316345374/1144840015856291890) channel within the [UNSW Redback Racing Discord](https://discord.gg/fVErHVAapj) server.
