### CAN & CANBUS

#### CAN Basics
Similar to HTTP, USB or other communication methods over wires, CAN is a communication standard that works to asyncronously connect the sensors of a vehicle to each other and a central computer (ECU).

CAN is used in various applications such as automotive vehicles, farming machinery and even some aviation applications due to the robustness of the standard.

##### Key points
* All types of CAN frames have a 64 bit payload, although not all 64 bits have to be used
* Each CAN frame is split into signals
* Can Frames are defined by a DBC file
* A CAN Bus is a network in which CAN data is sent through.
* There are two main types of CAN. CAN and CAN FD. CAN will only have a 11 bit CAN ID where as CAN FD can support up to a 29 bit CAN ID. The diagram below shows the frame breakdown of a CAN frame.
