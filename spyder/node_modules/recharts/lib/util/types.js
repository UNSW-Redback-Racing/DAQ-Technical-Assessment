/**
 * Determines how values are stacked:
 *
 * - `none` is the default, it adds values on top of each other. No smarts. Negative values will overlap.
 * - `expand` make it so that the values always add up to 1 - so the chart will look like a rectangle.
 * - `wiggle` and `silhouette` tries to keep the chart centered.
 * - `sign` stacks positive values above zero and negative values below zero. Similar to `none` but handles negatives.
 * - `positive` ignores all negative values, and then behaves like \`none\`.
 *
 * Also see https://d3js.org/d3-shape/stack#stack-offsets
